# Untitled Wordpress Boilerplate plugin

Simple library to speed up the process of building post types, removing unwanted headers etc. This is pulled in as a package and the `Boilerplate::bootstrap();` method should be run at the **end** of your `functions.php` file.

## Usage

Simply pull in as a package through composer

```
...
"require": {
    ""seventyninepr/boilerplate": "~1.0"
}
...
```

* Write documentation on all of the features and how to use them.
